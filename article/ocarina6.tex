\begin{abstract}
In this paper we propose an optimal method for tuning a six holes ocarina,
this optimization will be subordinated by the minimization of 
the square norm of square difference between the desired and obtained resonant frequency.
The results show that it is not possible tuning a John Taylor style six holes ocarina with a perfect equal temperament scale,
but the minimization rule returns a tuning method with an optimal approximation and heterogeneous errors less than $43.697\%$ of a semitone.

\section{Introduction}
The ocarina is an extremely ancient musical instrument widely used in worldwide. 
It is classified as a globular flute,
depending on the culture we can find shapes like animals, vegetables or anthropomorphic.
Exist vestiges of clay ocarinas in 
Shang dynasty peoples in Bronze Age China, 
Bantu peoples of Southern Africa,
pre-Columbian cultures in Peru, etc.
\cite[pp. 589]{apel1969harvard} \cite{sachs1940history} \cite[pp. 31]{leinweber2020art} \cite{rossi2020recuperacion}.

The ocarinas around the world present many fingering tune methods and musical scales,
one the last fingering style for 4 holes pendant-type ocarina was developed around 1964 
by the English mathematician John Taylor 
to approximate the tuning of a equal temperament scale 
\cite[pp. 79]{metropolitan1985american} \cite[pp. 10]{galpin2001newsletter}.
In this method, 
the degree of approximation to an equal temperament scale depends a lot on the ability of the potter or craftsman
in to choose the correct size of area and clay thickness in all the tone holes.

The work presented here, will study the math behind the whistles (an ocarina without tone holes)  
or more formally a Helmholtz resonant cavity \cite{corning2011resonance} excited by a jet-edge-resonator system \cite[pp. 3]{gibiat2013acoustic} \cite[pp. 138]{nyborg1953characteristics}. 
Additionally will be studied some proposed models to describe 
in a whistles with tone holes (an ocarina)
the resonant frequency in function of the size area and  clay thickness in the tone holes 
\cite{mp2010ocarina} \cite[pp. 44]{cabreraestudio} \cite{1999air}.
Finally, using a cost function an optimal tuning method will be presented 
and the approximation error will be shown.

The Fig. \ref{fig:ocarinaview} represents the hole distribution of the ocarina
used in this work, where $S_0$ represent the sound hole (voicing)
and the holes $S_1$, $S_2$, $S_3$, ... and $S_6$ represent the tone-holes.

The fingering chart used in this ocarina model is based in the 
4 holes fingering style proposed by John Taylor \cite[pp. 79, 146]{metropolitan1985american}, the
Table \ref{table:chart} shows the fingering chart, it indicates the configuration of open or close holes
to produce the tones from $C$ until $D$ (a higher octave ), where a value $S_i=1$ represents an
open hole and the value $S_i=0$ a closed hole.

\section{Math and music}
In this paper we analyze a tuning method with 12 tone equal temperament; so that, the frequency interval
between any pair of adjacent notes has the same ratio $\rho = {\sqrt[12]{2}}$.
The Table \ref{tab:notes} shows how are distributed the musical notes from tone $C$ until $D$ (a higher octave ),
where $f_0$ represent the frequency of $C$ note and the next notes
follow the geometric progression $\hat{f}_{i}={\rho}^i f_{0}$ with $i$ representing the separation degree with $C$.

\section{Math and ocarina}

\subsection{Analyzing a whistle}
We can think of an ocarina as a whistle with tone-holes in its resonant cavity,
so that when we open and close some of these holes we can modify the tone of generated sound.
Thus to understand the math of an ocarina first we should to know the science behind the whistles  
or more formally a Helmholtz resonant cavity \cite{corning2011resonance} (see Fig. \ref{fig:resonador}) excited by a jet-edge-resonator system (see Fig. \ref{football-referee-whistle}) \cite[pp. 3]{gibiat2013acoustic} \cite[pp. 138]{nyborg1953characteristics}. 
In this sense the Eq. \ref{eq:Apito} 
\begin{equation} 
\label{eq:Apito}
 f_0 = \frac{c}{2 \pi} \sqrt{\frac{A_{0}}{l_{0}V} }  
\end{equation}
shows the way of to calculate the frequency $f_0$ of a theoretic\footnote{A sphere-like resonant cavity and the open area of the neck is much less than the total surface area of the resonant cavity. .} whistle \cite[pp. 3]{gibiat2013acoustic} \cite[pp. 5]{kobayashi20093d} \cite[pp. 265]{okadanumerical}
in relation with the constants $\pi$  and $c$ (the velocity of sound),  and 
the variables: $V$ the volume of its resonant cavity,
$A_0$ is its cross-section area and $l_0$ the effective length of the neck in the resonator.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Analyzing an ocarina}

The fundamental resonant frequency $f$ of an ocarina, 
that have at least one circular tone-hole %pitch hole 
in addition to the sound hole (see Fig. \ref{fig:ocarina-teorica}),
can be represented like a function of the total tone-holes area $A$.


\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.750\columnwidth]{ocarina-teorica.eps}
\caption{Theoretic ocarina}
\label{fig:ocarina-teorica}
\end{figure}

In the article ``La Ocarina de Zanahoria a Carrot Ocarina'' \cite{mp2010ocarina}
were analyzed data about of the increment of resonant frequency $f$ in relation to the augment of area $A$,
showing that in that study case the relationships between the variables can be approximated with a line 
\begin{equation}
f=c_1+ c_2~A.
\end{equation}
where $c_1=595.859069$, $c_2=4.324273$ and a mean square error $MSE=8051.1$.
The Fig. \ref{fig:models} show the linear curve in relation to the collected data.


\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.850\columnwidth]{compara.eps}
\caption{Comparing models. }
\label{fig:models}
\end{figure}

By other side, 
if we follow the equation proposed by Bart Hopkin in its book ``Air Columns and Toneholes'' 
\cite[pp. 44]{cabreraestudio} \cite{1999air},
we can fit the data of Fig. \ref{fig:models} with a root square function
\begin{equation}
f=d_1\sqrt{d_2+A},
\end{equation}
where $d_1=91.215856$, $d_2=33.262474$ and a mean square error $MSE=5993.3$.
We must highlight that $d_2$ represents the area of sound hole. 

This last model fit better the data, 
also the equation proposed by Hopkin keep coherence with the Helmholtz resonator equation (see Eq. \ref{eq:Apito}).
In the next section we use the model proposed by Hopkin to obtain a optimal tuning in 
John Taylor style six holes ocarina.

\subsection{Resonance frequency in ocarinas}


If we assume the equation \ref{EcA} proposed by Bart Hopkin \cite[pp. 44]{cabreraestudio} \cite{1999air},
\begin{equation} \label{EcA}
 f = \frac{c}{2 \pi} \sqrt{\frac{\frac{A_{0}S_{0}}{l_{0}}+\frac{A_{1}S_{1}}{l_{1}}+\frac{A_{2}S_{2}}{l_{2}}+ . . .}{V} }   
\end{equation}
as a good approximation to estimate the fundamental frequency $f$ 
of globular resonators that have at least one circular pitch hole in addition to the sound hole (a.k.a. an ocarina). 
in which $A_i$ and $l_i$ are the area an the effective length of the $S_i$ tone-hole,
so that the variable $S_i$ has only have two values $\{0,1\}$ according the Table \ref{table:chart},
additionally $S_0=1$ and represent the sound hole, being $A_0$ and $l_0$ their corresponding variables. 



\subsubsection{Reordering the resonance equation}
We can rearrange the Eq. \ref{EcA} defining the variable $h_{i}\propto \frac{A_{i}}{l_{i}}$, so that
\begin{equation} \label{EcC}
 h_{i} \equiv  \left( \frac{c^2}{4 {\pi}^2 V}\right) \left( \frac{A_{i}}{l_{i}}    \right);
\end{equation}
This variable change imply that the Eq. \ref{EcA} can be rewrite as
\begin{equation} \label{EcD}
 f^{2} = \sum_{i=0}^{6}{S_i h_i}.
\end{equation}
It is important remember that following the Eqs. \ref{eq:Apito} and \ref{EcD},
when all the tone-holes are close we obtain that 
\begin{equation} \label{EcDa}
f_0^{2} = h_0.
\end{equation} 



\section{Problem Statement}


\begin{mydef}[
$\mathbf{\hat{z}}$ - Square value of the desired frequencies]
Known the frequency relation between the notes showed in the Table \ref{tab:notes}, 
we define the variable $\hat{z}_i\equiv \hat{f}_i^2 = \left( {\rho}^{i} f_0 \right)^{2} $,
so that the  column vector $\mathbf{\hat{z}}= \left[ \hat{z}_1, \hat{z}_2, \hdots, \hat{z}_{14}\right]^{T} $, 
that contain the square value of the desired frequencies, 
can be represented as in the Eq. \ref{eq:vecz}.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:vecz}
\mathbf{\hat{z}}
\equiv \mathbf{p} f_{0}^2
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{p}=[\rho^2,~\rho^4,~\rho^6,~\rho^8,~...,~\rho^{28}]^T$.
\end{mydef}

\begin{mydef}[
$\mathbf{z}(\mathbf{h})$ - Square value of the generated frequencies]
If we rearrange the Eqs. \ref{EcD} and \ref{EcDa} for all notes in Table \ref{table:chart},
we obtain the next equation
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:genfec}
\mathbf{z}(\mathbf{h}) =  \mathbf{q}h_0 +  \mathbf{A} \mathbf{h}
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{q}
=  
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\ 
1 \\ 
1 \\ 
1 \\ 
1 \\ 
1 \\ 
1 \\
1 \\ 
1 \\ 
1 \\ 
1 \\ 
1 \\ 
1 \\ 
1
\end{bmatrix}
, \qquad \mathbf{A}=
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 
\end{bmatrix}, 
\end{equation}
$\mathbf{h}=[h_{1},~h_{2},~h_{3},~h_{4},~h_{5},~h_{6}]^T$ and 
$\mathbf{z}(\mathbf{h})=[z_{1}(\mathbf{h}),~z_{2}(\mathbf{h}),~...,~z_{14}(\mathbf{h})]^T$.
Being $z_{i}(\mathbf{h})$ the square value of $i-th$ frequency generate by the ocarina given a $\mathbf{h}$ 
relation of areas and effective lengths in its tone-holes.
\end{mydef}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Minimization rule and optimal value}
Known and calculated the desired and generated frequencies seen in the Eqs. \ref{eq:vecz} and \ref{eq:genfec},
we propose the next minimization rule
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:minimization}
e^2(\mathbf{h})= || \mathbf{\hat{z}} - \mathbf{z}(\mathbf{h}) ||^2,
\end{equation}
where the unknown variable is the vector $\mathbf{h}$.
This problem can be fitted as a case of multiple linear regression 
that can be solved using the Tikhonov regularization
\cite[pp. 79, 80]{pujaicoriverafernando2020}.
Thus, following this method, we obtain the vector $\mathbf{h}^{*}$ that minimize the function $e^2(\mathbf{h})$,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:optimalh}
\mathbf{h}^{*}=
 \left(\mathbf{A}^T\mathbf{A}\right)^{-1}\mathbf{A}^T
 \left(\mathbf{p}-\mathbf{q}\right)
h_0,
\end{equation}
if we use this results joint the Eqs. \ref{EcDa} and \ref{eq:genfec}, 
we obtain that
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{z}^{*}=
\left(\mathbf{q}
+\mathbf{A}\left(\mathbf{A}^T\mathbf{A}\right)^{-1}\mathbf{A}^T
 \left(\mathbf{p}-\mathbf{q}\right) \right)
f_0^2,
\end{equation}
being $\mathbf{z}^{*}$ the square value of the generated frequencies
that minimize the function $e^2(\mathbf{h})$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Results}

\begin{mydef}[$E_1$ - relative tuning error ]
\label{def:max:E1}
The first type of error used in this work is 
\begin{equation}
E_1=100~\frac{f_b-f_a}{f_a}~\%,
\end{equation} 
that measures the difference error of $f_b$ in relation to the target frequency ($f_a$) or relative tuning error.


To obtain the biggest accepted relative tuning error,
It is necessary to know the fact that between any two consecutive notes, with frequencies
$f_a$ and $\rho f_a$, exist a proportion of $\rho\approx 1.059463$ (a semitone), this mean
that the next consecutive note is ever a $+5.9463\%$ that the last note. Thus, 
if we set as maximum error the midway position in geometric proportion between notes, them 
the biggest accepted positive relative tuning error 
to avoid a tone recognition mistake, it is equal to $+2.9302\% \equiv 100 (\sqrt{\rho}f_a-f_a)/f_a~\%$.
By other side 
the biggest accepted negative relative tuning error 
to avoid a tone recognition mistake, it is equal to $-2.8468\% \equiv 100 (f_a/\sqrt{\rho}-f_a)/f_a~\%$.

\end{mydef}

\begin{mydef}[$E_2$ - semitone error]
\label{def:max:E2}
The logarithmic difference error between two frequencies $f_a$ and $f_b$ in relation to a semitone ($\rho$) is
defined as
\begin{equation}
E_2=100~\frac{ln(f_b)-ln(f_a)}{ln(\rho)}~\%, 
\end{equation}
called here as semitone error.


To obtain the biggest accepted semitone error,
we use a similar criterion as seen in the Def. \ref{def:max:E1},
so that 
if we set as maximum error the midway position in geometric proportion between notes (ex: $C$ and $C\#$), them 
the biggest accepted positive tuning error 
to avoid a tone recognition mistake, it is equal to $+50\% \equiv 100~\frac{ln(\sqrt{\rho} f_a)-ln(f_a)}{ln(\rho)}~\%  $.
By other side 
the biggest accepted negative semitone error 
to avoid a tone recognition mistake, it is equal to $-50\% \equiv 100~\frac{ln( f_a/\sqrt{\rho})-ln(f_a)}{ln(\rho)}~\%  $.
\end{mydef}


\subsection{Analyzing the optimal $\mathbf{h^*}$}
In the Eq. \ref{eq:optimalh} was calculated $\mathbf{h^*}=[h_1^*,$ $h_2^*,$ $...,$ $h_6^*]^{T}$, 
the optimal vector that minimize the function $e(\mathbf{h})$. 
The Table \ref{table:h} shows each element of this vector in relation to $h_0$, 
being that $ h_{i}^*/h_{0} \equiv  \left( \frac{l_0}{A_0}\right) \left( \frac{A_{i}}{l_{i}}    \right)$.
\begin{table}[h]
\center
\resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{%
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline                           
$h_1^*/h_0$ & $h_2^*/h_0$ & $h_3^*/h_0$ & $h_4^*/h_0$ & $h_5^*/h_0$ & $h_6^*/h_0$ \\ \hline
\hline                           
 29.3\% & 58.1\% & 96.1\% &103.5\% &104.1\% & 12.2\%  \\ \hline
\end{tabular}}
%\vspace{5pt}
\caption{Percentage ratio between $h_{i}^*$ and $h_{0}$.}
\label{table:h}
\end{table}

In this table we observe that if 
we consider $l_{i}$ a constant in all ocarina 
then $h_{i}^*/h_{0} \propto A_{i}$ and 
the percentages presented in the Table \ref{table:h} describes the ratio of proportions between areas $A_i$.
So that below this conditions 
the optimal area $A_{2}$ is about twice $A_{1}$, 
the optimal area $A_{3}$ is about $3.27 A_{1}$   
and so on.

this column is equivalent to the root square value of $\mathbf{\hat{z}}$.
The third column has the optimal generated frequencies,
this column is equivalent to the root square value of $\mathbf{z^*}$.
The fourth and fifth columns have the errors described in the Definitions \ref{def:max:E1} and \ref{def:max:E1},
respectively.

The worst error $E_1$ is equal to $+2.556\%$ and correspond to the note $F$,
similarly this note present the worst error $E_2$ with a detour of $43.697\%$ of a semitone.
The next worst error $E_1$ is equal to $+1.796\%$ and correspond to the note $A\#$,
having an error $E_2$ with a detour of $30.819\%$ of a semitone.

By the results show in the Table \ref{table:res}, we observe that 
the optimal vector $\mathbf{h^*}$ causes that $e^2(\mathbf{h^*})> 0$
and consequently a perfect equal temperament scale 
it is not possible to be applied in the tuning of a John Taylor style six holes ocarina
only an optimal aproximation.

\subsection{Proposed tuning method}
From the data of the Table \ref{table:res}, 
we can infer an ocarina construction method that fulfill 
an optimal tuning following the minimization rule of the Eq. \ref{eq:minimization}.
In this sense if we choose of this table a set of notes, 
in which each current note use a new tone hole in relation to the last tuned note, 
we can obtain a tuning method or sequence to reach an optimal tuning.

With these considerations, the Table \ref{table:example1} shows one tuning method 
in which is considered a $C$ note equal to $523.2511 hz$.
The method consist in follow the table \ref{table:example1} line a line the from top at bottom.
So that we set in our ocarina, with each new created tone hole, 
the semitone error ($E_2$) shown in the fourth column of the table.

\section{Conclusion}
The results of Table \ref{table:res} shows that it is not possible tuning a John Taylor style six holes ocarina with a perfect equal temperament scale,
but the minimization rule presented in this work returns a tuning method with an optimal approximation and heterogeneous errors less than $43.697\%$ of a semitone.
Additionally, the Table \ref{table:example1} shows one, of several possibles, construction methods, 
paths or sequences to fulfill an optimal tuning according the minimization rule defined in the Eq. \ref{eq:minimization} and with 
the resonance frequency in ocarinas proposed by Bart Hopkin.
This method can be complemented with the information of the relations between areas $A_i$ and effective lengths $l_i$ 
in an optimal tuning shown in the Table \ref{table:h}.
